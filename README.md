### About this project

This is me playing around with react redux, react router(6) and styled components my own way.

### Having my own way

 - You will notice even the file naming is non-conventional, or probably what you are not used to, but where is
the joy without crazying around? 😁😁

 - Send in PRs

Cheers!
